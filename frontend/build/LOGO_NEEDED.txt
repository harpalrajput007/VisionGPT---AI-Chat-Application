IMPORTANT: VisionGPT Logo Missing

The application expects a logo file at:
/public/VisionGPTLogo.png

Please add your VisionGPT logo image to this location.
The logo should be:
- PNG format
- Square aspect ratio (recommended: 512x512px)
- Transparent background preferred
- Professional design representing the VisionGPT brand

Until the logo is added, you may see broken image icons in:
- Login page header
- Register page header  
- Chat sidebar header

The application will still function normally without the logo.
